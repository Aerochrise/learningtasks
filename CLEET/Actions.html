            Treatment
If a doctor diagnoses malnutrition, they will make a treatment plan for the person. The person may also need to meet with a nutritionist and other healthcare providers.

Treatment will depend on the severity of the malnutrition and the presence of any other underlying conditions or complications.

It may include:

ongoing screening and monitoring
making a dietary plan, which might include taking supplements
treating specific symptoms, such as nausea
treating any infections that may be present
checking for any mouth or swallowing problems
suggesting alternative eating utensils
In severe cases, a person may need to:

spend time in the hospital
gradually start taking in nutrients over a number of days
receive nutrients such as potassium and calcium intravenously
